rkillr router rebooter
==============

Currently a pet thinger for my home router. 
Sometimes my router acts up and to set it straight it requires a reboot. 
This script checks for connectivity and reboots the router. It also notifies when the reboot is done (and times it!).

To run, install the following python packages:
	beatifulsoup4
	requests
